CHALLENGES:
1.Accuracy of Geolocation Data: Ensuring the accuracy of geolocation data retrieved from devices can be challenging, especially in areas with poor GPS signal or high interference.
2.Battery Drain: Continuous use of GPS can drain the device's battery quickly, so optimizing power consumption while maintaining location accuracy is crucial.
3.Privacy Concerns: Handling and storing location data raise privacy concerns, so you'll need to implement robust data protection measures to comply with privacy regulations.
4.Network Connectivity: The system relies on network connectivity to transmit location data, so disruptions in network coverage can affect data transmission and reliability.
5.Distance Calculation: Accurately calculating the distance between the user and the designated location (e.g., school, office) can be challenging due to factors like road conditions and terrain.
